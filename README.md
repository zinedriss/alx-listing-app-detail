# ALX Listing App

The **ALX Listing App** is a modern frontend scaffold for an Airbnb-style property listing platform. This project sets up the foundational structure using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **ESLint** to ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable code. It serves as the starting point for future milestones that will build out dynamic and responsive listing features.
